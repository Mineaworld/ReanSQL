Default Cursor (Standard)

When to use: The default cursor should be visible when the user is not interacting with clickable elements.

Behavior: A standard arrow cursor will be used across the app, giving users a simple and familiar experience.

Pointer Cursor (Clickable Elements)

When to use: For all interactive elements such as buttons (e.g., Submit), clickable questions in the list, and any other clickable interface components.

Behavior: The cursor will change to a hand icon (pointer) to indicate interactivity, making it clear to the user that these elements are clickable.

Examples:

Submit Button: The cursor should switch to a pointer when hovered over the blue Submit button.

Question List: When hovering over a question in the list on the left panel, the cursor should change to a pointer.

Text Input Cursor (Code Editor)

When to use: When the user clicks into the code editor or any text input area.

Behavior: A standard I-beam cursor (text input cursor) will appear when the user clicks into the code editor to indicate they can start typing.

Examples:

SQL Code Editor: When clicking into the text area on the right panel to write a query, the cursor will become an I-beam.

Resize Cursor (Resizing Panels)

When to use: If the app design allows resizing of panels (e.g., the left panel with questions and the right panel with the code editor).

Behavior: The cursor will change to a resize icon (usually a double arrow cursor) to indicate the user can resize the panels.

Examples:

Panel Divider: If a vertical divider between the left and right panels can be dragged to resize the area, the cursor will change when hovering over the divider.

Error Feedback Cursor (On Error Highlight)

When to use: When the user makes an error in their SQL query.

Behavior: The cursor will change to a not-allowed icon (circle with a line) over the specific erroneous code or when hovering over areas requiring correction, reinforcing that the input is incorrect.

Examples:

Error Highlight: When the user hovers over a part of their code that contains an error (e.g., highlighted in red), the cursor may show the not-allowed icon to signify the error.

Loading Cursor (During Data Processing)

When to use: If the app is processing a user's query or loading data, such as waiting for the system to check a SQL query or parsing a PDF.

Behavior: The cursor will change to a loading spinner (hourglass or spinning circle) to inform the user that an operation is in progress.

Examples:

Query Submission: After the user clicks Submit, while the system checks the query, the cursor will become a loading spinner until the feedback is shown.

Help Cursor (AI Assistance)

When to use: When the user clicks or hovers over the AI chat support button for hints or guidance.

Behavior: The cursor will turn into a question mark or help icon when hovering over the AI assistance chat area.

Examples:

AI Chat Button: The cursor changes when hovering over the button or icon to indicate that the user can ask the AI for help.

Guidelines for Cursor Design:
Consistency: Ensure that cursor changes are consistent across all interactive elements to enhance user familiarity.

Smooth Transitions: Avoid abrupt cursor changes that could confuse users. Transitions between different cursor states should feel natural.

User Feedback: Ensure that the cursor change serves as a clear visual cue for the action that can be performed, enhancing accessibility and usability.


Accessibility: Use hover effects and cursor changes that are easily perceivable for all users, including those with visual impairments.
